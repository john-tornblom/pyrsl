pyrsl |Build Status| |Coverage Status|
======================================

pyrsl is an interpreter for a language called RSL (Rule Specification Language).
RSL is commonly used as a template language to express transformations from a
`BridgePoint <https://www.xtuml.org>`__ model into a textual representation,
e.g. when writing model compilers or when generating html documentation from a
model.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
POSIX users with python available on thier system may grab **gen_erate.pyz**
from `a release <https://github.com/xtuml/pyrsl/releases>`__. The .pyz
file contain pyrsl and all of its dependencises, and may be executed directly
without installing anything:

::

    $ chmod +x gen_erate.pyz
    $ ./gen_erate.pyz -h

Optionally, the .pyz file may be added to your PYTHONPATH:

::

    $ export PYTHONPATH=some/path/gen_erate.pyz
    $ python -m rsl.gen_erate -h

pyrsl is also available from pypi:

::

    $ python -m pip install pyrsl
    $ python -m rsl.gen_erate -h


Windows
*******
Generally, Windows users don't have python installed. However, `pyrsl 
releases <https://github.com/xtuml/pyrsl/releases>`__ include
**gen_erate.exe** that contain pyrsl and all of its dependencies, including
python.

Command Line Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To remain backwards compatable with `the original RSL interpreter
<https://github.com/xtuml/generator>`__, some command line options are a bit
confusing. Also, some of the options are not used by pyrsl.

pyrsl also contain a few additional command line options not available
in the original RSL interpreter:

  -include    Add a path to list of dirs to search for include files.
  -diff       Save a diff of all emits to a filename.
  -emit       Chose when to emit, i.e. never, on change, or always.
  -force      Make read-only emit files writable.
  -integrity  check the model for integrity violations upon program exit

For more information, see the help text by appending -h to the command line
when executing gen_erate.

Developer Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
pyrsl depend on pyxtuml, see its `github page
<https://github.com/xtuml/pyxtuml>`__ for install instructions.

Test suites
***********
pyrsl contain a set of unit tests that may be executed:

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/xtuml/pyrsl.git
    $ cd pyrsl
    $ python setup.py test


Customizing gen_erate
*********************
pyrsl may be extended to include additional builtin functions, i.e. bridges,
and additional string formatters. The extensions may be added to your own pyz
file by invoking **package_pyz.sh** located in the pyrsl source root folder:

::

    $ ./package_pyz.sh -main examples/customization.py
    $ ./gen_erate.pyz -nopersist -arch examples/customization_test.arc
    Running my custom version of gen_erate
    customization_test.arc: 4:  INFO:  the md5 of 'hello world' is 619d201e5209d3d52342cc5b6616b0cf
    customization_test.arc: 11:  INFO:  the md5 of hello world is 5eb63bbbe01eeed093cb22bb8f5acdc3

See `customization.py <https://github.com/xtuml/pyrsl/blob/master/examples/customization.py>`__
and `customization_test.arc <https://github.com/xtuml/pyrsl/blob/master/examples/customization_test.arc>`__
for more information.

issue <https://github.com/xtuml/pyrsl/issues/new>`__. If you plan on
sending pull request which affect more than a few lines of code, please file an
issue before you start to work on you changes. This will allow us to discuss the
solution properly before you commit time and effort.
